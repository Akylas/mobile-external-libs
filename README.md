# External dependencies for Carto Mobile SDK

Here are copies of external libraries used on CARTO Mobile SDK. Some projects are modified to port them to work on all required mobile platforms.

## Dependencies
In addition to the included libraries, a copy of recent version of boost library 
(http://www.boost.org, version should be 1.58 or newer) is needed. It is expected
that boost library is linked or copied to external-libs/boost.

## Compiling
No need to compile any of the libraries here. For Windows Phone build, libs-external/angle/prebuilt/angle.zip file
should be unpacked in place.

## License
All the projects have non-viral open source licenses. See License and Readme files for each.
